# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to create a map which can display earthquake data gathered from several sources.  The map was created using the mapbox api and leaflet.  Within the map itself, the points represent earthquakes within the past 7 days.  Additionally, there is a layer which distinguishes major earthquakes (those with a magnitude of over 4.5) from the rest of the earthquake data.  Also there is a layer which shows the tectonic plates in order to demonstrate their relationship with the earthquakes.  Three different background layers have been added to the map and they can be selected between within the layer selection at the top right of the screen.  Finally, a legend has been added in order to give additional visual distinction to earthquakes of different magnitudes.
